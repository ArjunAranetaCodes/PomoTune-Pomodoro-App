# Pomotune

Pomotune is a productivity app designed to help you manage your time more effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. This technique involves working for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes) followed by a short break. After four work sessions, you take a longer break. This cycle helps maintain high levels of productivity and creativity.

## Features

- **Focus Mode**: Minimize distractions and stay focused on your tasks.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep track of your productivity over time.
